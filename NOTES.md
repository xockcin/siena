## A CSA app

### 4/15/21

This is a phone app for the Siena Farm CSA program. It will give you a rundown of the items in this week's box, which you can click on for more information and recipes. You will be able to save your favorite recipes and your favorite ingredients, and also browse all recipes and all ingredients.

I would like take a first stab at building this app. So what am I building? My Figma prototype could hardly be simpler: There is a splash screen, followed by a scrollable list of CSA items, each of which has a title and an avatar picture. If you tap one, it brings you to a page, also scrollable, with information about the item and a list of recipes.

It occurs to me that the content I want to have in my app is all in the weekly email. I good start would simply be to take that content and put it into the app.

So what do I need? Not much! Really just three screens: splash, item list and item view. The splash will just be a graphic; the item list and item view screens will be scrollviews.

Update: I have the basic layout. My struggle is to get the images to show up in the items. For some reason it's not working. I will stop for now and keep working on it later.
